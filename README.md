When I'm asked about learning computer programming from first principles, I share this story…

I started to play drums a while back. It was fun. I went and bought a used drum set and just started banging on it. I made a joyful noise. 

I wanted to play with others so I learned the forms of music so we could collaborate. 

Then I was told to really understand drums I had to learn from other players. So I listened to their music. 

Next I was told to really understand drums I had to read music. So I read books.

Next I was told to really understand drums I had to get a degree. So I took classes. 

Next I was told to really understand drums I have to build my own drum kit. So I went bought all the individual pieces and assembled in my own kit. 

Next I was told to really understand drums I had to build my own drums from scratch. So I went and bought some goats to make my own drum heads. 

Now I spend most of my time raising goats and don't have much time to bang on the drums. 

However, the goats make their own joyful noise.
